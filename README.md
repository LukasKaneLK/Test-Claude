# Pomodoro Timer

A beautiful, focused Pomodoro timer built as a modern PWA-ready web app. Clean UI, phase-reactive colors, accurate background timer, and delightful audio feedback.

---

## Features

- **Pomodoro cycle** — Focus → Short Break → Focus → … → Long Break (every 4 sessions)
- **Accurate timer** — Timestamp-based (`Date.now()` + `endTime`) so the countdown stays precise even in background tabs
- **Phase-reactive UI** — Background gradient, progress ring, and button color shift with each phase (rose → teal → indigo)
- **Animated progress ring** — SVG circular arc drains as time elapses
- **Session dots** — Visual indicator of how many focus sessions have been completed in the current cycle
- **Background music** — Ukulele track plays during Focus sessions
- **Button click sounds** — Tactile audio feedback on every interaction
- **Mute toggle** — Silence all sounds with one click
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — `Space` start/pause · `R` reset · `S` skip
- **Dark / Light mode** — Persisted in `localStorage`, respects OS preference on first visit

## Timer Logic

The engine uses an **absolute end-timestamp** approach instead of decrementing a counter:

1. On `START` / `RESUME`, `endTime = Date.now() + remainingMs` is stored in state.
2. A `requestAnimationFrame` loop reads `Date.now()` each frame and computes `remainingMs = endTime - now`.
3. On `PAUSE`, the remaining time is captured and `endTime` is cleared.

This means the timer is immune to `setInterval` drift and background tab throttling.

## Pomodoro Cycle

```
[Focus] → [Short Break] → [Focus] → [Short Break] → ... → [Long Break] → [Focus] → ...
                                                    ↑ after N focus sessions (default: 4)
```

Default durations (all configurable via `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in `src/features/pomodoro/engine/types.ts`):

| Phase | Duration |
|---|---|
| Focus | 25 min |
| Short Break | 5 min |
| Long Break | 15 min |
| Sessions before long break | 4 |

---

## Audio

- **Focus music** (`bensound-ukulele.mp3`) — starts when the timer starts, stops on pause, reset, or phase change away from Focus.
- **Button clicks** (`Button_press.wav`) — plays on every button press.
- Both are silenced when the **Mute** toggle is active.
